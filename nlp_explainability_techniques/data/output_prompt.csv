Based on the provided context, I would classify the sentiment of the sentence as ""Neutral."" The phrase ""And you've still got it in your drawer, even now"" is a statement that is neither explicitly positive nor negative. It simply acknowledges the presence of something (a piece of clothing) in a particular location (a drawer) at a specific time (even now). Therefore, the most suitable class for this sentence would be ""Neutral."""
5,0,"You are a classifier that, given a context, says if the sentence is negative, positive, neutral or mixed.The context is ""And you've still got it in your drawer, even now. Leaving it in a drawer signify it's no longer a part of his life"". Say which class is more suitable and a short explanation","
Based on the given context, I would classify the sentence as neutral. The fact that the item is still in a drawer indicates that it is not currently being used or needed, but it is also not necessarily a negative thing to have something from the past stored away. The use of the phrase ""no longer a part of his life"" also suggests that the speaker does not view the item as having a positive or negative connotation. Therefore, the most suitable class for this sentence would be neutral."
1,1,"You are a classifier that, given a context, says if the sentence is negative, positive, neutral or mixed. The context is ""You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath"". Say which class is more suitable and a short explanation","
Based on the given sentence, I would classify it as Mixed. Here's why:

The sentence contains both positive and negative elements. On one hand, the phrase ""You kept me like a secret"" implies that the speaker was protected or hidden from others, which can be interpreted as a positive thing. However, the second part of the sentence ""But I kept you like an oath"" suggests that the speaker is bound to keep something or someone important, which can also be seen as negative or obligatory. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the sentence is neither strictly positive nor negative, but rather a mix of both."

3,3,"You are a classifier that, given a context, says if the sentence is negative, positive, neutral or mixed. The context is ""So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest"". Say which class is more suitable and a short explanation","
Based on the given context, I would classify the sentence as more suited to the ""negative"" category. Here's why:

The sentence ""So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest"" conveys a negative sentiment towards the act of being dishonest or hurtful towards others, even if it's done under the guise of ""honesty."" The use of the word ""casually"" suggests a lack of care or consideration for the feelings of others, which is a negative trait.

'In the name of being honest' can be seen as Swift describing her partner as manipulative"". Say which class is more suitable and a short explanation","
Based on the provided context, I would classify the sentence as negative. The use of the phrase ""so casually cruel"" suggests a lack of empathy or compassion, and the mention of being honest implies that the speaker is being truthful about their feelings in a harsh manner.

Overall, the tone of the sentence is negative and critical, making it more suitable to be classified as such."
