Based on the provided information, I would classify the sentence as ""Mixed."" Here's why:

* The sentence contains both positive and negative elements. On one hand, the phrase ""it's love"" connotes a positive emotion, indicating that the person is experiencing romantic feelings. On the other hand, the phrase ""he's gonna say it's no longer a part of his life"" implies that the person is letting go of something, which can be seen as negative.
* The sentence also implies a sense of finality, as the person is leaving the sentiment in a drawer, indicating that it is no longer a part of their life. This adds to the mixed classification, as it suggests that the person is moving on from the feeling but still acknowledges its existence.

Based on the sentence provided, I would classify it as mixed. Here's why:

* Negative: The sentence does contain words with negative connotations such as ""cruel"" and ""bein' honest"". However, the overall tone of the sentence is not entirely negative. There is a sense of irony or sarcasm in the use of the word ""casually"", which implies that the speaker is being nonchalant about something that they know is actually harmful or hurtful.
* Positive: The sentence does contain some positive words such as ""bein' honest"", but again, the overall tone is not entirely positive. The use of the word ""cruel"" suggests that there is something wrong or unjust in the situation, which negates any positive connotations.
* Neutral: The sentence does not contain any particularly strong emotional language or imagery, and the tone is generally flat and matter-of-fact. However, the use of the word ""cruel"" gives it a slightly negative leaning, making it more suitable for the mixed class.

In summary, while there are some positive words in the sentence, the overall tone is mixed because of the negative connotations associated with the word ""cruel"".",So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest,0,3,False
